This is my collection of Ports packages for OSX's MacPorts package management 
system. Some are already included in the main MacPorts repository, some are
not. 

The main focuse of these ports are science analysis programs and their 
dependents. 

If you wish to access them (no guarantees!), check out the git repository and
add the path to your sources.conf. 

For more informaiton on the MacPorts system, please see the main project page
